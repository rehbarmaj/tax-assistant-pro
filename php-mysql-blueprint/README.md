# Tax Assistant Pro - PHP/MySQL Blueprint

This folder contains a basic blueprint for building the Tax Assistant Pro application using a traditional PHP and MySQL stack. This is not a functional application, but rather a structural guide and starting point.

## File Structure

- `/schema.sql`: Contains the MySQL `CREATE TABLE` statements to set up the database structure that mirrors the data models used in the Next.js version.
- `/config/db_connect.php`: A sample file for handling your database connection. You would fill in your actual credentials here.
- `/includes/header.php`: A template file for the common HTML head section and top navigation of your application.
- `/includes/footer.php`: A template file for the common HTML footer section and script includes.
- `/*.php` (e.g., `dashboard.php`, `products.php`): These are placeholder files for each page of your application. They demonstrate how you might include the header and footer, and where your page-specific logic and HTML would go.
- `/public/`: A folder to hold publicly accessible assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

## How to Use

1.  **Set up Database**: Use the `schema.sql` file to create the tables in your local or remote MySQL database.
2.  **Configure Connection**: Update `config/db_connect.php` with your actual MySQL database host, username, password, and database name.
3.  **Build Out Pages**: Start populating the placeholder `.php` files with your application logic. You will need to write PHP code to query the database and use that data to generate your HTML.
4.  **Style the Application**: Add your CSS rules to `public/css/style.css` to style the application.
